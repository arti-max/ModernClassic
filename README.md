# ModernClassic - A Voxel Game Engine Project

<p align="center">

</p>

A procedural voxel world exploration and creation game inspired by early versions of Minecraft, built from the ground up in Python using the **Ursina Engine**. This project showcases a custom-built rendering pipeline, dynamic chunk management, and a physics system to create an infinite, modifiable world.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Procedural World Generation:** Infinite, voxel-based terrain generated on the fly.
- **Dynamic Chunk System:** Efficiently loads and unloads parts of the world around the player to save memory and maintain performance.
- **Custom Rendering Pipeline:** A from-scratch `Tessellator` class that builds chunk meshes, handling ambient occlusion and basic lighting.
- **Physics and Collisions:** A simple and effective physics implementation for player movement and interaction with the world.
- **Block Interaction:** Place and destroy blocks to shape the world around you.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Designed to be built and run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

This project is built entirely in Python 3, leveraging these key libraries:
- [**Ursina Engine**](https://www.ursinaengine.org/) - For the core 3D rendering, windowing, and entity management.
- [**NumPy**](https://numpy.org/) - For high-performance numerical operations, especially in world generation and data management.
- [**Nuitka**](https://nuitka.net/) - For compiling the Python code into a high-performance, standalone executable.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/arti-max/ModernClassic.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd ModernClassic
    ```
3.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file. You can generate one with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

### Running the Game

To run the game from the source code, execute:
```

python main.py

```

## üéÆ Controls

- **WASD** - Move
- **Mouse** - Look around
- **Space** - Jump
- **Left Mouse Button** - Place a block
- **Right Mouse Button** - Destroy a block

## üèóÔ∏è Building from Source

This project uses **Nuitka** to compile into a standalone executable.

### Windows

```

python -m nuitka --standalone --onefile --windows-disable-console --include-data-dir=res=res --plugin-enable=ursina main.py

```

### Linux

```

python3 -m nuitka --standalone --include-data-dir=res=res --plugin-enable=ursina main.py

```

### macOS

```

python3 -m nuitka --standalone --macos-create-app-bundle --include-data-dir=res=res --plugin-enable=ursina main.py

```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement a basic inventory system.
- [ ] Add more block types with unique properties.
- [ ] Improve world generation with biomes, trees, and structures.
- [ ] Introduce simple enemy mobs.
- [ ] Implement a day/night cycle.
